# What's useRef

`useRef` allows you to keep a mutable value within a component, similar to `useState` or instance variables on a class, without triggering re-renders.

For example, this component stores the number of clicks for a button:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
function RefButton() {
  const clicks = useRef(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => (clicks.current += 1)}>
      Clicks: {clicks.current}
    </button>
  );
}
```

:::

This is how this component looks like (I added a re-render button so you can
actually test it out üòÑ):

<InteractiveExample>
  The example below is completely interactive, try clicking the "Clicks" button
  and then click on "Re-render".
  {/* <OutsideVariableMultiple refs={1} displayType={false} displayTitles={false} /> */}
</InteractiveExample>

As you can see, if you click the "Clicks" button it doesn't do anything. However, after click on "Re-render", it gets updated with the number of clicks we did previously.

## Difference with a variable

You might wonder why not just use a simple variable as the example below:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
let clicks = 0;

function OutsideVariableButton() {
  return <button onClick={() => (clicks += 1)}>Clicks: {clicks}</button>;
}
```

:::

And here's an interactive example for it:

<InteractiveExample>
  {/* <OutsideVariableMultiple variable={1} /> */}
</InteractiveExample>

The button works the same way that our previous example. However, the problem arises when you have multiple instances of the same component like the example below. Try clicking just one of the buttons and then click on re-render to see the result.

<InteractiveExample>
  {/* <OutsideVariableMultiple variable={3} /> */}
</InteractiveExample>

As you were able to see, the clicks are not isolated. In fact, all the examples
from this article uses the same button component, so if you click the button
from the first example and then click on "re-render" on the second example, the count it is gonna be
incremented! What a bug üêõ.

On the other hand, `useRef` values are completely isolated between components:

<InteractiveExample>
  {/* <OutsideVariableMultiple refs={3} /> */}
</InteractiveExample>

## Difference with useState

> The main difference between useState and useRef, is that useState triggers a
> re-render and useRef doesn't.

In the following example I added two buttons: one that updates its count with `useRef` and the other one with `useState`. I added some labels so you can identify them easily.

<InteractiveExample>
  {/* <OutsideVariableMultiple refs={1} state={1} /> */}
</InteractiveExample>

You'll notice that clicking on the button with `useRef` doesn't trigger a re-render and thus, the view isn't updated. On the other side, when you click on the button that uses `useState`, it will update its clicks count immediately.

# Refs as a Way to Access Underlying DOM Elements

To perform imperative actions on DOM nodes, React provides a way to get a
reference to them via refs. All you have to do is to assign a `ref` property to
a node with a ref object like this:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
function CustomInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
}
```

:::
The way to get a DOM reference using refs works (informally üòÖ) as follows:

<!--
<Chat
  messages={{
    Today: [
      { message: "Hey React", side: "right", time: "12:00" },
      {
        name: "React",
        message: "Hey, what's up?",
        side: "left",
        time: "12:00",
      },
      {
        message: "Could you give me a reference to this dom node?",
        side: "right",
        time: "12:00",
      },
      {
        name: "React",
        message: "Sure, I assigned it to the 'current' property of your ref.",
        side: "left",
        time: "12:00",
      },
      { message: "Cool, thanks!", side: "right", time: "12:00" },
    ],
  }}
/> -->

On the first render, `inputRef`'s value will be `{ current: null }` and in the
following renders it will have its `current` property assigned to the specified DOM
node:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
// First render: { current: undefined }
// Second render: { current: <input /> }
// Third render: { current: <input /> }
/// ...and so on
console.log(inputRef);
```

:::

However, if you only reference `inputRef` inside `useEffect` then it'll always
reference the DOM node so you don't need to worry about it being undefined.

Let's update our example to get an idea of how this works:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
function AttachingToDomExample() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  console.log("Render inputRef value:", inputRef);

  useEffect(() => console.log("useEffect inputRef value:", inputRef));

  return <input ref={inputRef} />;
}
```

:::

Here's the console output when rendering this component:

| Render | Location  |          Value          |
| :----: | :-------- | :---------------------: |
|   1    | Render    | { current: undefined }  |
|        | useEffect | { current: <input /\> } |
|   2    | Render    | { current: <input /\> } |
|        | useEffect | { current: <input /\> } |
|   3    | Render    | { current: <input /\> } |
|        | useEffect | { current: <input /\> } |

As you can see, if you access the `inputRef` inside `useEffect` then you don't
need to worry about it being `undefined` because React will assign it
automatically for you.

# Real World Use Cases for Refs

Let's start with a simple real-world application for refs: `usePrevious`. This
hook stores the previous value for a given state variable.
[It is even referenced on React's docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state) as a way to "get the previous props or state". Let's see it in
action first:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
function UsePreviousExample() {
  const [clicks, setClicks] = useState(0);
  // usePrevious is the important part here ‚ú®
  const previousClicks = usePrevious(clicks);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setClicks(clicks + 1)}>
        Clicks: {clicks} - Before: {previousClicks}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

:::
Here's the output so you can play with it:

<InteractiveExample>{/* <UsePreviousExample /> */}</InteractiveExample>

You can notice that the `previousClicks` variable stores the value for the previous render
for a given variable. Here's its implementation:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
function usePrevious(value) {
  const ref = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = value;
  });
  return ref.current;
}
```

:::
Let's analyze how it works.

Let's simulate what happens on the first render. We can remove the call to
`useEffect` since it doesn't affect the return value on the first render:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
// First render
function usePrevious(value) {
  const ref = useRef();
  return ref.current;
}
```

:::
On the first render it is called with a value of `0`:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
// First render
const previousClicks = usePrevious(0);
```

:::

In this case, `usePrevious` will return `undefined`:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
// First render
function usePrevious(value) {
  const ref = useRef();
  return ref.current; // No assignment, so it's undefined
}
```

:::

After increase the value for count, here's how the `usePrevious` call will look:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
// Second render
const previousClicks = usePrevious(1);
```

:::

Since `usePrevious` is called again, its effect needs to run:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  ref.current = 0;
});
```

:::

After this, the `usePrevious` function is called again:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
// First render
function usePrevious(value) {
  const ref = useRef();
  return ref.current; // 0
}
```

:::

And so on. Here's the value for each render for both variables:

| Render | clicks | previousClicks |
| :----: | :----- | :------------: |
|   1    | 0      |   undefined    |
|   2    | 1      |       0        |
|   3    | 2      |       1        |
|   4    | 3      |       2        |

# Callback Refs

Callback Refs are a different way to set refs. It gives you a fine-grain control
over when refs are attached and detached because you provide a function instead
of a ref variable. This function gets called every time the component mounts and
unmounts.

[Here's an example](https://codesandbox.io/s/callback-ref-example-lqe8w?file=/src/App.js) that shows/hides an emoji every time you click its button.
The important thing here is the `ref` prop that we added. We use a function to log
the provided ref:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
const callback = (ref) => console.log("callback:", ref);

function App() {
  const [rerenders, setRerenders] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>{show ? "Hide" : "Show"}</button>
      {show && <span ref={callback}>üëã</span>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

:::

Here's an interactive version of the previous code (you can check the output in
the console to see that I'm not lying üôÉ):

<InteractiveExample>{/* <UseCallbackExample /> */}</InteractiveExample>

_Note: If you use callback refs as inline functions, it will be called
twice: one with `null` and another one with the DOM element.
This is because React needs to clear the previous ref every time the function is
created. A workaround for this is to use a class method._

# (Legacy) String Refs

<Warning>

[String refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#legacy-api-string-refs) are a legacy feature and they are likely to be removed in future React versions.

</Warning>

The way it works is that you provide a string as a ref value like `ref="exampleRef"` and it automatically gets assigned to `this.refs`.

_Note: String refs can only be used with class components._

Here's an usage example:

::: figure figure-code

```jsx
export default class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    console.log(this.refs);

    return (
      <div ref="exampleRef">
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ dummy: 0 })}>Re-render</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

:::

Here's the value for `this.refs` across renders:

| Render | this.refs                        |
| :----: | :------------------------------- |
|   1    | `{}`                             |
|   2    | `{ exampleRef: <div>...</div> }` |
|   3    | `{ exampleRef: <div>...</div> }` |
|   4    | `{ exampleRef: <div>...</div> }` |

As you can see, on the first render `this.refs.exampleRef` will be undefined and
on the following renders it will point out to the specified DOM node.

# Conclusion

We saw what `useRef` is, how it differentiates with a plain old variable and
state variables, and we saw real world examples that uses it. I hope that most
of the content makes sense to you!
